  Since 2011, HL has been hosting regular meetups in SAC 3.114. <strong>The idea is simple &mdash; smart people sharing their cool technology hacks, research, and tech demos with the UT hacking community.</strong>
</section>

<section class="leadin">
  We invite one presenter to speak at each event. Tech talks typically last 15-20 minutes, including time for questions. The idea is for each speaker to give us a quick preview into something cool that they're working on, much like a <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED talk</a>.

  Dinner is always served (usually Chipotle burritos or Austin's pizza).

  <h1>Speaker FAQ</h1>

  <h2>When and where do Tech Talks happen?</h2>
  <p>Tech Talks take place <strong>during our Hacker Lounge meetups - every other Tuesday at 7 PM in the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/sac.html">Student Activity Center</a></strong>, Room 3.114.</p>

  <h2>Who is welcome to speak?</h2>
  <p><strong>Anyone!</strong> We give preference to UT students and professors. But, we regularly host speakers from startups and tech companies. We like to mix things up! To get a better idea, take a look at our <a href="/past/">past events</a>.</p>

  <h2>What time should speakers arrive?</h2>
  <p>The event starts at 7 PM, but it is quite informal, so showing up 10-15 minutes before 7 PM is plenty of time.</p>

  <h2>What topic should I talk about?</h2>
  <p>The key word in "Tech Talk" is <em>tech</em> &mdash; we want technical topics that will be interesting to engineers and CS students. Talking about your weekend hack, side project, or research often makes a great Tech Talk. Note, a Tech Talk should not be a recruiting pitch. Focus on the technology &mdash; that's what people want to hear.</p>

  <h2>What is the time limit for each talk?</h2>
  <p>We cut speakers off after 15 minutes to keep things moving.  Speakers are welcome to hang out with us after for the rest of Hacker Lounge.</p>

  <h2>Who will be in the audience?</h2>
  <p>Hacker Lounges are <strong>open to the public</strong>, but the audience is predominantly UT CS/EE students. There are usually 20-30 people in attendance.</p>

  <h2>Who has given Tech Talks in the past?</h2>
  <p>Lots of people! UT students, professors, startup founders, UT researchers, etc.  Check out the full list of <a href="/past/">past events</a> and see for yourself!</p>

  <h2>What tools do presenters get?</h2>
  <p>We have a projector with VGA input and adapters from MiniDP and DVI, a large whiteboard, and wireless network access. Let us know if you need anything else.</p>

  <h2>I'm coming from off-campus. Where can I park?</h2>
  <p>You can find parking info at <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/parking/parking/visitor/">Visitor Parking</a>. </p>
