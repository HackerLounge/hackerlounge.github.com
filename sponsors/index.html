<h1 id='sponsor_acm'>Sponsor HL</h1>

<section class='leadin'>We’re glad to hear that you’re interested in helping out Hacker Lounge. We’re all about hosting events aimed at the UT Austin hacker community, and sponsoring these events is a good way to get your name known if you’re interested in recruiting from UT Austin.</section>
<p>If there are particular events you are interested in sponsoring, please let us know which, and how much you would like to contribute. If you don’t have a particular event in mind, we are always in need of funds we can apply across events, and we will happily give your company credit at events we fund using your contributions. We have included amounts that we request in order to sponsor an event, but we are always able to make use of contributions, however large or small.</p>

<p><strong>Here are a few events we do regularly:</strong></p>

<h3 id='friday_tech_talks'>Hacker Lounges.</h3>

<p>On every other Tuesday evening, we invite one speaker to give a brief technical talk at our Hacker Lounge event. Speakers are usually either students showing off cool projects they’ve been working on, or people from industry who come to talk about technical topics that might interest UT hackers. If you’re interested in giving a tech talk, check out hackut.com for upcoming open slots and send us an email at hackerlounge@hackut.com. For established companies who give tech talks, we request a minimum of $200 to cover the costs of food.</p>

<p>The key word in Tech Talk is tech &#8211; we want technical topics that will be interesting to CS and Engineering students. A Tech Talk should not be a recruiting pitch for your company, though it’s fine if you mention that you are recruiting. We want people to find the talks interesting even if they are not looking for a job, and a good Tech Talk is better than a recruiting pitch at getting the attention of UT Austin students anyway.</p>

<h3 id='hackathons'>Hackathons.</h3>

<p>Once per semester, HL hosts an intense coding competition for valuable prizes.  We rely on corporate sponsorship to be able to afford the prizes. Sponsors are welcome to attend the event (especially the demonstrations and judging at the end). We request $500 to $1000 to sponsor this event in order to cover prizes.</p>

<h3 id='workshops'>Workshops.</h3>

<p>At least once a semester, UT Austin hosts workshops to teach students useful real-world hacking skills. Hosting workshops is one of the best ways to gain respect for your company and show students that you’re more than just talk and no action.</p>
