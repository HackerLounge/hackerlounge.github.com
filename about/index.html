  We’re not here to build our resumes and nitpick about our GPA.  We’re here because we like to build stuff.  At a school with 50,000 students, we knew that there must be other students who shared this mindset, so we started Hacker Lounge.

  Hacker Lounge is a community for hackers at UT Austin. If this sounds like you, join us or follow us @hack_UT

  <p>“The true hacker can’t just sit around all night; he must pursue some hobby with dedication and flair. It can be telephones, or railroads (model, real, or both), or science fiction fandom, or ham radio, or broadcast radio. It can be more than one of these. Or it can be computers.”</p>
