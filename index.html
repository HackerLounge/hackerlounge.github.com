    <p>
    Michael was one of the initial founders of Hacker Lounge.  He's graduating in May and is going to share some experiences working with the VC firm Alsop Louie as an Associate for the past 3 years.  Michael will be graduating this semester, so don't miss this! It should be awesome, and since he's one of the founders of HL, it'll be a great way to send him off before he hatches his diabolical plans to take over the world.

    <p>
      John Kestner from the Austin-based company, Supermechanical, will join us to give a talk on its product (funded through kickstarter!) called Twine; Twine is a hardware device that's now sold in Apple's stores! This is a great opportunity to ask about how they're doing with a hardware product, and how kickstarter helped them out. Could be valuable insight if you're looking to start your own hardware project sometime.
